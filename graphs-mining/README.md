# Graphs mining

## Task

This small application looks for communities on undirected, single-layer, unweighted graphs. Each community is supposed to represent a dense subgraph that provides a high-level representation of the whole network.
In this study, communities are modeled as:
* Connected components of the k-core. An implementation of Batagelj, Zaversnik algorithm that computes k-cores in $O(m)$ time is provided (where $m$ is the number of the edges of the graph).
* Denser subgraphs. The densest subgraph is found in polynomial time by Goldberg's algorithm. 

## Dataset

* [Dolphins](http://konect.cc/networks/dolphins/),
* [Zebra](http://konect.cc/networks/moreno_zebra/)

Case study 2:
* [Yeast protein](http://konect.cc/networks/moreno_propro)


# Case study 1

A preliminary study regards a small community of 28 zebras and 62 bottlenose dolphins. A node represents a zebra (or a dolphin) and an edge shows that there was an interaction between two zebras (or two dolphins) during the study.

|                          |     dolphins    |      zebras       |
| ------------------------ | --------------- | ----------------- | 
| coreness                 |      k=5        |     k=12          | 
| n. of individuals k-core |    36/62        |    13/28          | 
| n. of individuals DSD    |    44/62        |    14/28          | 

Analyzing the densest communities found by the DSD and kcore algorithms, it is possible to see that:
* In both cases, the densest community accounts for about half of the population. 
* Zebras appear to form a very dense community with strong interactions, achieving a high level of coreness.

# Case study 2

This network contains protein interactions contained in yeast. A node represents a protein and an edge represents a metabolic interaction between two of them.  

Research showed that proteins with a high degree were more important for the surivial of the yeast than others. Looking at the degree distribution it is possible to see that a node can reach even a degree around 50.
